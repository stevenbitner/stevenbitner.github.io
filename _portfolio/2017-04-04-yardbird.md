Three weeks in, and things get better every day. I bought a 28′ Cape Dory sailboat about a month ago in anticipation of my 6-month stay in Newport. The boat looked great online and I took a chance. Incidentally, she looks great in person as well.

Great boat. Great location. Trouble is, she’s on blocks and stuck in the middle of a huge cluster of boats all out of the drink for the winter. I did not realize when I came out here that I’d be a yardbird for nearly two months, but that’s what is in the cards.

It’s a beautiful night in the neighborhood

New England, as it turns out, even after 20 years of my not being here, is still cold at night. Luckily I did not come out here until March so the worst of it was over, but with no way to heat the boat, anything below 25 or so feels a bit cold to me. I have had a few such nights, but with each passing day, the days get longer and the nights get warmer.

All this said, for anyone who knows me and my general optimism, I’m having a great time and enjoying my new digs. I look forward to getting out on the water and having easy access to luxuries such as a toilet, but until that time comes I’ll just (pee-pee) dance.

Many people call this a ladder, but when you’re classy like me, you call it a foyer
