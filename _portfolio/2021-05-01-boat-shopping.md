Things have "gotten real". We finally closed on our house in KC late last year and started casually looking at boats with a lot of help from [Jamie and Behan of Totem](https://www.sailingtotem.com/ask-the-cruiser). We were/are in no rush (and planning to pay cash) which is a good place to be. However, the global Covid pandemic has absolutely slammed the boat market. People are buying boats at insane prices, sometimes sight unseen, and as a result, we were quite happy to wait until the right boat presented itself.

We reached out to a buyerâ€™s broker in Fort Lauderdale to keep an eye out for boats and to represent our best interests in the buying process. We used [Jordan Yachts](http://www.jordanyachts.com/), and our broker Tom Harney has been an amazing asset from square one. He spent an hour or so talking with me on our first call, both listening to my description of our family and plans, and educating us on many facets of buying and owning a large boat.

A couple of months passed and we made an offer on a boat that was immediately rejected. We were later very happy because although the boat was in great shape, the layout might not have been the best for us and it had very little in the way of equipment. Then, a very similar boat hit the market and we headed down for our first trip since Covid started. The trip was a lot of fun, despite me having to work during the days and us pretty much just looking at a couple of boats. We snuck on over to Fort Lauderdale beach, Key Biscayne, and a bucket-list fan boat ride in the everglades.
