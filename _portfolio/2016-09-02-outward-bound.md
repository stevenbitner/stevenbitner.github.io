It has been a very long time since I have forayed a-sea. I think since I sold my sailboat back in 2002, I have not had any part in navigating or otherwise operating any boat other than my 9.9HP pontoon, which I often drive with my feet while holding a beer, so I do not think that qualifies as ship-handling.

Grete had expressed a concern that she was not confident in my ability to skipper a boat with our family aboard. As a result, I began searching for a sailing school. I recall that sailing lessons and certifications were free when I was on active duty so I searched for “veteran sailing”. What I found was so amazing that it was hard to believe.

It turns out that I was eligible, as are all veterans who continue to serve or have honorable discharges, to choose an Outward Bound course of my liking. I found this course [http://www.outwardbound.org/course/maine-coast-sailing-for-veterans/436/](http://www.outwardbound.org/course/maine-coast-sailing-for-veterans/436/) and applied to attend. My application was accepted and I was excited.

It’s worth noting that this program is funded by private donations. They did not disclose who those donors are/were, but did say that the Sierra Club was a big donor for the program. So, hats off to those folks. The program is totally free. When I say “free”, I mean “FREE”. I got a free flight from KC to Portland Maine. I got a free hotel room the night before and the night after the course. I took the course at no cost. I ate for free on board the boat. I paid for nothing but the gas Grete used driving me to and from MCI. Insane, and awesome. If you are a veteran…do yourself a favor and look into this. They have sailing, back-packing, dog-sledding…awesomeness.

Now, for the course and why it’s relevant. Well, it turns out that sailing is a lot like riding a bike. I had not sat at the helm, or plotted a course on a chart for 14 years. It did not matter. When I felt the boat heeling over, or heard the sails starting to luff, I knew we (or the wind) were changing course. When I plotted a course, I knew how to read the chart and adjust for magnetic North. It all came back to me. I was the only Navy vet on the boat, everyone else were from the other branches of the service. So, I was the one who knew what everything was called and the subtleties of sailing. The folks I spent the week with were hard-working, fast-learning people and I really enjoyed spending that time with them.

I’ll do a day by day in another post.
