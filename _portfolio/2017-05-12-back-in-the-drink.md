As much as living in a parking lot for the last two months has kept me from getting soft and has increased my general perspective on how wonderful my life overall is, yesterday was a great day.

The moment that Brightside’s keel touched it’s reflection on getting lowered was as beautiful as looking up at the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, and remarkably similar.

I spent the next hour and half rigging up the jib and making all preparations to get underway. Bleeding air out of seawater intake, burping the dripless shaft seal, etc. I was not able to bend and hoist the main since the halyard needs to be replaced and I was without the tools needed to do so. So I headed out with the plan of motor-sailing under the jib alone.

No one was present on the docks to help out in line handling, so I had to bring her in solo. I was a bit scared, since I haven’t driven a boat this size in about 15 years and pulling into a dock solo was never easy for me.

All went well. I pulled right in to my slip with no complications and stopped short of ramming anything. The slip right next to mine was still vacant, so next time might be a tighter squeeze, but all in all, everything went smoothly today and I loved EVERY second of it. I just wish Grete and the kids could have been here with me in more than spirit.
