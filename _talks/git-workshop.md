The talk was given as a part of our workshop supplements to assist students with fringe topics that when misunderstood have detrimental impacts on their ability to absorb primary course matter.

The slides can be found here [https://stevenbitner.github.io/git-talk](https://stevenbitner.github.io/git-talk).

There was also a small work-along lab that helped to display concepts of the staging area in Git as well as merge conflicts.
That repository can be cloned here [https://classroom.github.com/a/V3mtnZuo](https://classroom.github.com/a/V3mtnZuo).
