In this paper we consider finding a geometric minimum-sum dipolar spanning tree in R<sup>3</sup>, and present an algorithm that takes _O(n<sup>2</sup>log<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>n)_ time using _O(n<sup>2</sup>)_ space, thus almost matching the best known results for the planar case.
Our solution uses an interesting result related to the complexity of the common intersection of _n_ balls in R<sup>3</sup>, of possible different radii, that are all tangent to a given point _p_.
The problem has applications in communication networks, when the goal is to minimize the distance between two hubs or servers as well as the distance from any node in the network to the closer of the two hubs.
