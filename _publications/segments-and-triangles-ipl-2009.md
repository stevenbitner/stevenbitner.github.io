Given a set _S_ of _n_ points in R<sup>3</sup> we consider finding the farthest line segment spanned by _S_ from a query point _q_ given as part of the input, and finding the minimum and maximum area triangles spanned by _S_.
For the farthest line segment problem we give an _O(nlog<sub>2</sub>n)_ time, _O(n)_ space algorithm, matching the time and space complexities of the planar version.
The algorithm is optimal in the algebrai deision tree model.
We further prove that the minimum area triangle spanned by _S_ an be found in _O(n<sup>2.4</sup>log<sub>2</sub><sup>O(1)</sup>n)_ time and space, and the maximum area triangle spanned by _S_ an be found in _O(h<sup>2.4</sup>log<sub>2</sub><sup>O(1)</sup>h + nlog<sub>2</sub>n)_ time and _O(h<sup>2.4</sup>log<sub>2</sub><sup>O(1)</sup>h + n)_ space, where _h_ is the number of vertices of the convex hull of _S_ (_h_ = _n_ in the worst case).
