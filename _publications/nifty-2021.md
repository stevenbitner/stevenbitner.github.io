The Nifty Assignments special session is about promoting and sharing the ideas and ready-to-use materials of successful assignments.

Each presenter will introduce their assignment, give a quick demo, and describe its niche in the curriculum and its strengths and weaknesses. The presentations (and the descriptions below) merely introduce the assignment. A key part of Nifty Assignments is the mundane but vital role of distributing the materials - handouts, data files, starter code, rubrics, autograders - that make each assignment ready to adopt. Each assignment presented has complete materials freely available on the Nifty Assignments home page https://nifty.stanford.edu.

If you have an assignment that works well and would be of interest to the CSE community, please consider applying to present at Nifty Assignments.
