We disuss the problem of finding the minimum-sum dipolar spanning tree (MSST) in three dimensions.
The MSST problem is a minimization problem wherein given a set _S_ of _n_ points the goal is to find two points _x_, _y_ &isin; _S_ that minimize the sum |_xy_|+max{_r<sub>x</sub>_, _r<sub>y</sub>_}, where _r<sub>x</sub>_ and _r<sub>y</sub>_ are the radii of two disks with centers at _x_ and _y_, respetively, that together cover all points in S.
We present an _O(n<sup>2</sup>log<sub>2</sub>n)_ time algorithm that uses _O(n<sup>2</sup>)_ space, improving upon the known three dimensional result of _O(n<sup>2.5+&epsilon;</sup>)_ time and _O(n<sup>2</sup>)_ space.
