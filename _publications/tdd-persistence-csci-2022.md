The authors performed a prior study of a modified test-driven development approach to software development in a
first course in data structures. The current work is an attempt to follow up on the original work to determine if
students persisted in utilizing a test-driven development approach in a follow-on course in advanced data structures
and algorithm analysis. This paper addresses literature relevant to the use of test-driven development as a
pedagogical tool, the design of the current study, results, and recommendations emerging from this work.
