This is an attempt at simplifying **make**, I hope it can help anyone who struggling with the basics.

## Simplifying the Makefile

The simplest form for a Makefile is:
```make
TARGET: DEPENDENCIES
	COMMAND(S)
```

So, if you want to do some command or commands, give it a name (TARGET) and if the commands are dependent upon anything, list those dependencies.
For example, if I wanted to compile a simple **main.cpp** file the command would be `g++ main.cpp`.
I can name that command whatever I want, possibly snuka (my dog's name).
The main file in this example doesn't require files other than itself, so the dependency list would simply be itself.

```make
snuka: main.cpp
	g++ main.cpp
```

If that main file used a class I developed, such as ***Dog***, defined in **dog.cpp** and **dog.hpp**, then my main program will depend on that class.
Classes are most easily dealt with when compiled into object files such as **dog.o**.
Make will create the **dog.o** file automatically (or at least try to), if I need it.
So now my rule might need to be:
```make
snuka: main.cpp dog.o
	g++ main.cpp dog.o
```

If I wanted to name the executable snuka, rather than a.out (the default), the rule would be:
```make
snuka: main.cpp dog.o
	g++ main.cpp dog.o -o snuka
```

Thus, to build an executable file named **snuka**, which has a `main` function in **main.cpp** and uses code from the `Dog` class, I'd just need to run `make snuka`.
